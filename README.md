# ETL_SNOWFLAKE_PROJECT_CSV
 This project implements an end-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts sales data from a CSV file, transforms it using Python and pandas, and loads it into a Snowflake database. The pipeline includes data cleaning, transformation, and post-load validation, ensuring consistency and data integrity. Credentials are securely managed through a .env file.
